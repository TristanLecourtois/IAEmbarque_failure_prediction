# IAEmbarque_failure_prediction

This student project focuses on developing a **deep neural network (DNN)** for **predictive maintenance**, utilizing the **AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset**. The goal is to export and optimize this model for **execution on an STM32L4R9 microcontroller** using **STM32CubeIDE**. This project covers the complete **embedded machine learning development cycle**, from data preprocessing to final deployment.
